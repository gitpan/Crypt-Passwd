Crypt::Passwd - Interface to the UFC-Crypt library.

This module provides a simple interface to the UFC-Crypt's functions
crypt() and crypt16(). This can also be an interface to other similar
libraries as the actual functions are configurable. See below under
'CUSTOMIZATION'.

This module requires the UFC-Crypt Library written by Michael Glad. Keep
in mind that it's ILLEGAL to export that code from the US!

The module has been tested with a version circa 05/18/93 on FreeBSD and
Digital Unix systems.

To install this module, you must first download and install UFC-Crypt.
Insure it's working well before you proceed any further. Once ready,
copy libufc.a or equivalent library file to /usr/local. If the library
file is somewhere else or you decide to change the name, you will have
to change the file Makefile.PL to reflect your actual setup.

After this, you should do the following

		make
		make test
		make install

This code is subject to the same licensing scheme than perl itself and/or
the UFC-Crypt library. This code is provided as is, with no warranties.

CUSTOMIZATION:

If your version of UFC-Crypt doesn't include the crypt16() function,
you can edit the file 'config.h' and comment out the definition for
EXT_CRYPT. Note that in this case, the tests won't complete and a 
message about the missing function will be printed. Thanks to Lupe 
Christoph for suggesting this.

Other libraries can be used instead. For this, just replace 
the -lufc in the file Makefile.PL with the desired one. Also, edit
the file config.h to match for the function names you want to use.
The prototypes should be compatible with the standard crypt().

You're welcome to send feedback, bugs with the module and general ideas
to Luis E. Munoz, lem@cantv.net

Regards.
