Revision history for Perl extension Crypt::Passwd.

0.01  Mon Aug  3 20:41:48 1998
	- Initial release.

0.02  Sun Aug  9 09:45:03 1998
	- Added config.h to customize crypt*() methods to use. This
	allows users with an implementation of UFC-Crypt with no
	crypt16() to use the module easily. This also eases the use
	of other crypt() libraries. Thanks to Lupe Crystoph for poiting
	this out.
